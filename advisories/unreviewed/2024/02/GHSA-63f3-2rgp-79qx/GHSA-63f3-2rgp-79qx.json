  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntls: fix race between tx work scheduling and socket close\n\nSimilarly to previous commit, the submitting thread (recvmsg/sendmsg)\nmay exit as soon as the async crypto handler calls complete().\nReorder scheduling the work before calling complete().\nThis seems more logical in the first place, as it's\nthe inverse order of what the submitting thread will do.",
